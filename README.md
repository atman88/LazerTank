A Qt implementation of the lazer tank game inspired from http://habrahabr.ru/post/248001

This implementation offers an an experimental move input UI.

Previous input methods for this game favored entertaining the user at the
expense of the user's thought process. This implementation explores an alternative
method where moves are displayed as 'bread crumbs' as they are entered so that
the user is unhindered by the game's speed. In theory this approach should feel more
comfortable without compromising entertainment value.
