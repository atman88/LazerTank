A Qt implementation of the lazer tank game inspired from http://habrahabr.ru/post/248001

This implementation offers a structured code base and an experimental move input UI.

Abstract:
Traditional input methods for this genre tend to favor entertaining the user at the
expense of the user's thought process. This implementation explores an alternative
method where moves are displayed as 'bread crumbs' as they are entered, and the game
then animates the moves at its own pace. In theory this approach ought to feel more
comfortable to the user without compromising its traditional entertainment value.
