<H1>LazerTank</H1>
<p>
<H3>A capture the flag puzzle game</H3>
</p>
<p>
<H2>Available Commands:</H2>
</p>
<p>
<H3>Shoot - space bar</H3>
Fire the tank's laser once, cummulatively
</p>
<p>
<H3>Shoot multiple times - numeric keys</H3>
Fire the tank's laser the specific number of times
</p>
<p>
<H3>Move - arrow keys</H3>
Drive the tank in the direction of the arrow key
</p>
<p>
<H3>Move to a specific square - mouse left click</H3>
Move the tank to the mouse position. To succeed it must be possible for the tank to move
to the square that the mouse is pointing to. The tank will find the shortest path to the
given square
</p>
<p>
<H3>Move along a specific path - mouse drag</H3>
Dictate a path for the tank by moving the mouse while holding down the left mouse button
</p>
<p>
<H3>Capture the flag - c</H3>
Press c to move the tank to the flag. Works if the tank can find a possible path to it
</p>
<p>
<H3>Pause - Ctrl</H3>
Hold down the Ctrl key to pause. Focus switches from the last pending move to
the tank so that by default, entering moves while paused replaces any outstanding moves.
While paused, focus can be changed using the Home and End keys
</p>
<p>
<H3>Undo - backspace</H3>
Erase the last pending move. Ctrl-backspace erases all pending moves. This undoes pending
tank movement - it does not undo completed tank moves. To undo completed moves, use
<a href="#autoreplay">Auto Replay</a>
</p>
<p>
<H3>Speed control - s</H3>
Typing the s key toggles the tank's speed between high and low. The default is low.
High speed is useful if/when you find yourself waiting for the tank to catch up. In low
speed, the tank will make adjustments to it speed as the number of outstanding moves
increases
</p>
<p>
<H3>Menu - Esc or right mouse click</H3>
Open the menu. Using the right mouse click to open adds some additional context for the
square under the mouse cursor
</p>
<p>
<H3>Select Level - Alt L</H3>
Choose a level to open
</p>
<p>
<H3 id="autoreplay">Auto Replay - Alt R</H3>
Watch a replay of completed moves. Entering commands during replay (such as Esc) allows
game play to resume from the current point in time. This is useful for undoing the
remaining committed moves. Selecting replay before any moves have been entered replays
the last time the level was succesfully completed
